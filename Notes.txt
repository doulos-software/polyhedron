Notes


The polyhedral analogy likens Scripture to a shape whose facets are sections of scripture and whose edges are links.

Abbreviations and acronyms are given in an accompanying text-file.

Words in {brackets} denote "facets" which [ostensibly] have their own text-file for further illumination.
